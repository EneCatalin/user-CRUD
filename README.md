# user-CRUD
Just a small CRUD site demo where the user does CRUD operations on a db. Will use mongoose. May contain react, but probably not.


Accidentally uploaded the keys, those will be deleted in a couple days but may as well stay for now.


Front end design is not mine, it's copied with a small ammount of modification. For the back-end used everything from tutorials to stackoverflow.


The way I delete and update the page needs to be deleted and replaced with something more fitting with react (ie, updating just the table). 


So, that's about it for now.
